# Why Swift

I choose Swift and also I am currently learning Swift and Swift is very amazing language and it use in many high-tech companies like Apple, Microsoft and Google and it is made for making app for iOS, iPad, MacOS, WatchOS and TvOS and I like Swift and it's my favourite programming language and I planned to learn Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, StoryBoard, Xcode and I am using Xcode for my iOS Development and I am learning from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithChris">@CodeWithChris</a> and I hear by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry">@CodeWithHarry</a>

### Why not android

I can't use android development because I don't like it and it is not modern and iOS Development is very modern and futuristic and also I don't like Kotlin and Java is awesome but Google end support for java and make kotlin for android and Kotlin is official programming language also it is not worth it because see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry](https://www.google.com/search?q=salary+of+ios&sca_esv=565412338&rlz=1C5CHFA_enIN1071IN1071&sxsrf=AM9HkKkXMkXRElShwhncvvqd-H4YB7TqiA%3A1694718122245&ei=qlgDZY3DDoedseMPuLWssAs&ved=0ahUKEwiNwK795KqBAxWHTmwGHbgaC7YQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=salary+of+ios&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiDXNhbGFyeSBvZiBpb3MyBBAjGCcyChAAGIAEGBQYhwIyCBAAGIoFGJECMgoQABiABBixAxgKMgcQABiABBgKMgcQABiABBgKMgcQABiABBgKMgcQABiABBgKMgcQABiABBgKMgcQABiABBgKSPETUMENWI8ScAF4AZABAJgB5AGgAagDqgEFMC4xLjG4AQPIAQD4AQHCAgoQABhHGNYEGLAD4gMEGAAgQYgGAZAGCA&sclient=gws-wiz-serp)https://www.google.com/search?q=salary+of+ios&sca_esv=565412338&rlz=1C5CHFA_enIN1071IN1071&sxsrf=AM9HkKkXMkXRElShwhncvvqd-H4YB7TqiA%3A1694718122245&ei=qlgDZY3DDoedseMPuLWssAs&ved=0ahUKEwiNwK795KqBAxWHTmwGHbgaC7YQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=salary+of+ios&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiDXNhbGFyeSBvZiBpb3MyBBAjGCcyChAAGIAEGBQYhwIyCBAAGIoFGJECMgoQABiABBixAxgKMgcQABiABBgKMgcQABiABBgKMgcQABiABBgKMgcQABiABBgKMgcQABiABBgKMgcQABiABBgKSPETUMENWI8ScAF4AZABAJgB5AGgAagDqgEFMC4xLjG4AQPIAQD4AQHCAgoQABhHGNYEGLAD4gMEGAAgQYgGAZAGCA&sclient=gws-wiz-serp">salary of an iOS Developer</a> but only we code Swift in only MacBook or iMac 

### Simple Project

```swift
let n = 54

if n >= 10 && n < 20 {
  print("n is between 10 to 20")
}
else if n >= 20 && n < 50 {
  print("n is between 20 to 50")
}
else if n >= 50 && n < 100 {
  print("n is between 50 to 100")
}
```
## Explaining this project

The variable ```n``` stored 54 and n is greater than 50 and lesser than 100 so ```else if n >= 20 && n < 50``` execute
